# TexnoMagic

**TexnoMagic** is a free and open source Python 3 library and format for magic
symbol recognition and symbol-based language parsing.

I created **TexnoMagic** after prototyping serveral systems for magic
symbol recognition and invocation as well as systems for creating magic
language based on symbols. You can read my posts about
[Theory of Magic](https://texnoforge.dev/words-of-power-devlog-1-theory-of-magic.html) and
[Invocation of Magic](https://texnoforge.dev/words-of-power-devlog-2-invocation-of-magic.html)
to get better idea of what I'm trying to achieve.

Please have a look at [wopeditor] the graphical frontend for **TexnoMagic**.
