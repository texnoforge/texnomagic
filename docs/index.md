# TexnoMagic

**TexnoMagic** is a free and open source Python 3 library and format for magic
symbol recognition and symbol-based language parsing.

I created **TexnoMagic** after prototyping serveral systems for magic
symbol recognition and invocation as well as systems for creating magic
language based on symbols. You can read my posts about
[Theory of Magic](https://texnoforge.dev/words-of-power-devlog-1-theory-of-magic.html) and
[Invocation of Magic](https://texnoforge.dev/words-of-power-devlog-2-invocation-of-magic.html)
to get better idea of what I'm trying to achieve.


## Status

**alpha**: integration with [wopeditor]/Godot

* save and load symbols to/from user files
* portable open format based on simple JSON/CSV files
* first user-created alphabets uploaded to [wop.mod.io]
* train Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) from symbol data
* real-time symbol recognition
* spell language parser based of Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG)
* available as python module or TCP server

* ‚ö† format and API not stable yet
* ‚ö† docs need more content


## Install

TexnoMagic is available from [PyPI]:

```
pip install texnomagic
```

You can install/develop from source as with any other python module.


## Use

### Python üêç

See [reference docs] for `texnomagic` python module.

Use `tests/` and [python-wopeditor] as examples.

### TexnoMagic TCP server

You can start language-agnostic TexnoMagic server as a python module:

```
python -m texnomagic.server
```

or compile a binary using PyInstaller:

```
pyinstaller server.spec
# results in dist/texnomagic-server
```

### Godot

[wopeditor] contains GDScript implementation of TCP client for TexnoMagic
server.
